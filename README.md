Therefore the client, at first, is adressed to age related training in their inital state. And by getting stronger they can change to a more active group. The Fitness Studio Sweden has an intent of creating activities in fitness suitable for active people that has a busy schedule, but love and prioritize team supported training.

### Testing
The site has been developed to not have to much distracting elements or heavy graphic to be able to keep good scores in measurements. Overall performance is good but could improve for responsiveness and improve both HTML and CSS features. 

### Testing
There are still minor responsive and graphical bugs. Such as the list dots that keeps on showing even though tested several methods for hiding them with CSS, but with no luck with my current experience and knowledge of the subject. There is also a visability problem or a UX/UI problem with contrast between layers of text and background images. I tried to set this with a backgroud overlay with a lower Z index but with no luck.

### The site har been tested with the following software:
<li> High overall measurements both mobile and desktop, Lighthouse, Google Developer Tools (Page Speed Insights)
<li> No errors with the official [W3C validator] (https://validator.w3.org/)
<li> No errors with the official [Jigsaw validator] (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Deployment
The site was deployed to my GitHub pages, late in the progress. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch. Once selected Master pages, the page will get automatically updated. With a detailed indicator or ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. There was trouble for me to deploy and the commands from Codeanywhere didn't update the files correclty. There was also a big issue with the relative paths, it did not work at all not / or ../. I had to take the published site name in the URL to be able link it correctly, to be able to browse.

### Credits
For the HTML and CSS parts credits is given to Code Institue and the Love Running project. I have tried different versions of HTML and CSS throghout the project and when I tried tot specify them further they always by the en collapse something else. In the parts that I was able to adjust I have done it in earlier commits to Git. But for the assigments I had to deliver a running product to be able to document it further. Therefor I simplyfied it at the end to be able to have a deliverable and a working product, event thoug it could be developed with more advanced CSS layers, but Im rather new to this so I see this as a way of learning in the progress. I have put credit text in the files. But there is also credits to be given to W3C.org. 

### Content
The text for the pages was in most part taken and prompt generated from Open AI Chat GPT. To be able to have a mix of relevant text and info rather than Lorum ipsum. To be able to fit content this has also been shorted down along the project. Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Sign Up page was taken the lecture fron Code Institute and the Icons is from Fontawesomes free icon list. 

### Media
The images and photos used on all the pages are from Unsplash and edited down to match the format.
