<!--  Credit: Code institute and the Project: Love Running - I have donde Several changes have been done in the .html code and the .css do during this development. 
Many the other tested did not act out well or as I wanted in the final styling. Therefore I had to use the structural thinking and reuse code from the Love Running project. 
To be able to deploy the site and to do this with less error. This is a work in progress and a first submisson, and it was helpful knowledge trying to put the first part of this site together. -->
